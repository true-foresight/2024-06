## If Khalistani Separatists Were to Copy Israeli Forces

It is already well known that Britain and the US orchestrated the creation of Israel after WWII via the George C. Marshall plan, mainly to eliminate Palestine, to expel as many Jews from Europe as possible, and to create a wedge within Asia-Minor so that the Arabs, Turks, and Persians could be pitted against each other. 

Similarly, after WWII, when the British Viceroy of India was made to exit South Asia and relocate to Burma (Myanmar) by India's newly formed federal government, the border and territorial issues in North Western and North Eastern parts of India were exacerbated by Britain's foreign policies. 

So, if the Khalistani factions being incubated in Britain, America, Canada, and Australia were to be launched as expeditionary units onto the Arabian Sea shores within the "contested region" between Pakistan and India, it might only take 30 to 40 years for Khalistan to emerge as a new country in South Asia, the way Israel did in the contested regions between Turkish-Cyprus, Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan. 

Factual history is already available for all of us to learn from, particularly about the many more wars that were generated after WWII, out of pure greed and arrogance, by the US and the UK, in: Central and South America, Central Europe, the whole of Africa, South-East Asia, and Oceania. 

Geopolitical hot spots like Colombia, Cuba, Sierra Leon, Niger, Congo, Sudan, Ukraine, Libya, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kashmir, Tibet, and Taiwan, have continued to suffer undue distress with no hopes of peace in the coming future, because of ongoing interference being conducted in those regions by North American, British, Australian and European state-sponsored entities and international policies. 

Using Khalistani expeditionary units to spearhead the creation of yet another war-torn region in the world, would conveniently allow American and British fossil fuel corporations and weapons manufacturing companies, to make windfall profits in the coming decades, and to reinforce their so-called "International 'Rules' Based Order" via racism and perpetual wars.   

Would anybody on this planet be surprised, if a Khalistan were to be created in between Pakistan, Russia, and India via direct financial, political and military support from western countries, the way Israel was created in the Middle-East?
